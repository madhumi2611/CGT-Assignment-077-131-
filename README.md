Before running the code, make sure that python libraries- networkx and matplotlib are installed in your system.

It can installed using the following cmd prompts:
1- pip install networkx
2- pip install matplotlib

We used the following Python libraries:

1- networkx (for constructing graph network)
2- heapq (for implementing Dijkstra algorithm)
3- random (for generating random weights for the edges)
4- matplotlib (for plotting graphs created using networkx)
5- copy (for the purpose of making deep copies of mutable data types)

Along with text outputs for each question, we have additionally included two graph outputs,

1- Graph generated from the given sequence (if it is graphical)
2- Graph of Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), using Kruskal'sÂ algorithm
